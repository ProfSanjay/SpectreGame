public class Game {

    // Start Screen --> Welcome Message, New/Load Game Options
    // New Game --> Enter player name, race choice, stat distribution, etc.
    // Load Game --> Pulls basic data from .txt file (name, race, stat/resources
    // distribution, inventory, floor level, and actionCount)

    // Play --> do while loop that runs until players quit
    // Two main functions --> in Dungeon && in Town
    // Follow state diagram for each functionality

    // Necessary to create --> classes for characters, items, stats, monsters
    // Logic for how to progress

    // AND EVERYTHING WILL NEED TESTS
